# Python-image-enhancement-with-bright-dark-prior

Python implemenation of [Nighttime low illumination image enhancement with single image using bright/dark channel prior](https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13640-018-0251-4).  
Some of the codes are different from original paper because I noticed some descriptions there are wrong.  

Only support Python2 for now.
